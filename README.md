# Sumobot examples with Javascript and Arduino Language

These are the implementations I have used in our office robot wars / fights.

You will find robots controlled with a keyboard, smartphones applications and snes controllers, my next goal is to controll my bots with a dualshock controller.
The code to run the robots are varied, from Arduino Language to Javascript using [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/) or [Cylon.js](https://cylonjs.com/), my next goal is to use [Gobot](http://gobot.io/) to control my next tiburoncin.

USB Snes controller works with node v0.10.33, for more information look at [cylon-joystick-snes](https://github.com/joaquinnunez/cylon-joystick-snes)
